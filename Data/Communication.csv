Those videos are usually linked to specific music but this creator has a video with no music and some environmental noises that are barely noticeable. This shows no audio editing and most importantly no linking his video to the musics that would also work as tag and could expand his visibility. The use of hashtags in the video description is very limited and not similar to most videos doing the same trend which is unclear if it is for lack of understanding or choice. They used written words in the video like it is commonly done for this trend and did not use ASL.,Yes,Communication

Some disabled people just want to participate in popular things like everyone else and as a future computer scientist I hope to bring this topic to whatever product I end up working with.,Auto-ethnographic Reflection,Communication

I believe he uses ASL but not necessarily sure if he is saying the same sentence that is floating on the screen. The audio had no editing, which means he did not use the usual music associated with this trend. This also means that his video is not linked to the rest of the trend by the music and his reach is compromised. Also, they use only one hashtags and it does not match other's use of hashtag for this trend.",Yes,Communication

Offering ways to tag a video to a trend without having the music playing in the background could be something to be explored by TikTok.,Auto-ethnographic Reflection,Communication

Like, I struggle with carpal tunnel from how horrible my work posture is and that already makes me terrified, but to imagine that also impeding my primary forms of communication? I would just. Be so anxious.",,Communication

It would be really easy for me to just throw my hands up in the air and despair.",,Communication

At least on some level, I know how disheartening it is to have such a unique issue that it's hard to get advice or support on it. It means a lot when you can finally find someone else who understands what you're going through. I do appreciate her acknowledgement of positivity and that there are actions she can take, but I'm familiar with that despair.",,Communication

Kinda highlights her struggles as a deaf person, and kinda forces her audience to understand what it means to be in her world.",Yes,Communication
