Emily mentions the diversity trend in higher education but without the equity side of it. This means that schools are trying to bring minorities to their campuses but once they are there there are little to no support to their specific needs. Which brings up another problem as pointed out by Emily that is internalized Ableism. She shares that having to request accommodations or ask professors for some flexibility is a struggle for most disable people but she pointed out how important it is to do it in order to overcome that barrier and succeed in academia. Based on their dialogue, part of the problem is the institutions, staff, and faculty lack of understanding disabilities and how those accommodations do not mean a special treatment or take away from the student's qualification.",,Mobility

Her comment “as a person who has trouble surviving the common cold” shows how she disproportionally is affected by a regular cold and how the pandemic situation took a toll on her mental health and willingness or fear to go places. In the second paragraph, exposed a difficult reality for those who depend of others for their most basic personal needs. She previously had 10-15 personal care aides to help her with 6 hours of daily basic needs but their inability to isolate themselves presented a risk to Emily. This generated an internal conflict between getting infected and having her basic needs met. Like she said “for the first time ever in adulthood, I’ve found myself resentful and wishing for the ability to truly live independently without the need for assistance with my daily activities”. This shows the constant mental exhaustion that she must have felt on top of having to face all the stress we all had to deal.",,Mobility
Anonymous 2,https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/2021/03/10/my-year-of-nothing-but-everything/,Vaccination priority and roll out,,,,"wheelchair, COVID, vaccine, Ableism, equity, public health, coronavirus, Ableism","Third paragraph points out the initial guidelines for vaccination did not consider people under 65 with high-risk to be the highest priority. This generated months of anxiety and when they finally moved people under 64 with high-risk to highest priority, Emily battle became to prove she was one of them to whoever was responsible for the vaccination. Lack of guidelines, information, proper procedure, and systematic Ableism lead to Emily trying to prove she was in that group even though being of young age.
Fourth paragraph goes in detail how the state’s recognition of her need for early vaccination did not translate to accessible vaccination. Places responsible for distriburing vaccines had people entering their information to register for vaccination on demand and Emily’s compromised motor abilities made it extra difficult for her to fill out those forms quickly in order to guarantee a spot. Also, this same system would generate one day’s notice appointment which for someone who relies on others to almost everything is like she says “the disable nightmare”.",,Mobility
Anonymous 2,https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/2021/03/10/my-year-of-nothing-but-everything/,Systematic Ableism when trying to get vaccinated,,,,"wheelchair, COVID, vaccine, Ableism, equity, public health, coronavirus","Fifth and sixth paragraph show Emily’s continued battle to try to overcome the systematic Ableism in trying to receive a vaccine which state of Pennsylvania had on paper that she was eligible to get. She brings up that young abled students were able to get vaccinated through a partnership between her university and the state because those students had contact with patients but she was still denied to receive her dose. Emily expose the difficulty to get an appointment through CVS since it was open to millions of people, the inability to get vaccinated through her school even though that was a much smaller set of eligible students, and the fact that private medical practitioners were overwhelmed by the general public and did not present a viable way for her to get her vaccine or even general information. She brings up how she saw the “shrug of responsibility from numerous institutions” when confronted about the lack of vaccination equity.",,Mobility
Anonymous 2,https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/2021/03/10/my-year-of-nothing-but-everything/,Use of Facebook and systemic bias during COVID,,,,"white supremacy, BIPOC, privatization, bias, Ableism, COVID, Facebook","Paragraphs seven and eight expose some of the systematic Ableism and overall inequality. Emily starts be sharing her use of the social media Facebook and a tool to connect and see shared experiences of others trying to get the vaccine, understand what is happening, or express joy for finally being vaccinated. Emily points out that Facebook became a double swarded resource since it helped her see the broader difficulties faced by different communities of her region and see that she was not alone but at the same time the Facebook group exposed “emotional extremes”. She points out that it was challenge to handle those emotional appeals online and it also revealed how disable lives overall were disproportionally left out since the beginning of quarantine. Emily includes BIPOC into her analyses of those left out and criticizes white supremacy as part of the US medical bias. Other spect Emily writes about is the “history of defunded public health in favor of privatization” which lead to poor infrastructure and unequal system is the exchange of the ultimate goal of profit which affected minorities disproportionally. Like she mentions, disable lives were not celebrated before and most likely will not receive recognition for their loses due to covid, being once more purposefully unseen by our society.",,Mobility
Anonymous 2,https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/2021/03/10/my-year-of-nothing-but-everything/,Internalized Ableism and community importance,,,,"wheelchair, COVID, vaccine, Ableism, equity, public health, coronavirus, confinement, BIPOC","The last four paragraphs expose the intersectionality and mutual support among marginalized communities and how important their mutual support is for their survival. Emily shares that she got her first dose on February 17th on a day’s notice opportunity that was 1.5 hours away from her. This is a clear demonstration of how inaccessible the process was. Emily had the help of a queer BIPOC to help her achieve her vaccination goal and how that same person was tested positive a few days later which put her in stress and made Emily feel bad for having asked that person to expose themselves and because of that they could have potentially exposed other. As Emely reports “anyone who lives independently dependently knows the internalized Ableism that materializes as guilt for asking for too much from others” which gives us a peek of how Ableism can manifest within a disable person which I imagine to be mentally challenging to deal with because on matter how she feels she still cannot change her condition. Another peek to a disable person journey during COVID, “asking the people I love to knowingly expose themselves while waiting for my test results was something I hope to never need to do again” this shows that a disable person who have been exposed still have to rely on someone willingness to take them to a testing site which also means willingness to expose themselves. Emily ends her letter by wishing that after the health and institutional disparities that the COVID situation helped expose will gain more national visibility even after the pandemic and hopefully trigger systematic changes. Lastly, she calls it the Year of Nothing but still recognizes her emotions, bedroom confinement, and marginalized communities as her everything during that challenging year.",,Mobility
Anonymous 2,https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/2021/03/10/my-year-of-nothing-but-everything/,Meta level summary and personal takes,,,,"wheelchair, COVID, vaccine, Ableism, equity, public health, coronavirus","This text is a great insight of how sometimes things are not necessarily what they are portrayed to be. The vaccination roll out has been advertised as an equitable and on paper it is however Emily shows us that systemic Ableism does not disappear even when top officials try to implement a fair approach. Her need is easy to understand and quite obvious to see but still she struggled to get her first vaccine. It is worth mentioning that Emily is finishing her PhD program and is probably very resourceful, very comfortable with science, and capable to understand and handle the situation still she struggled to get something she was entitled to. The vaccination eligibility was made equitable but the accessibility to it was not. It is also important to notice that days’ notice vaccination is not something disable people can easily accommodate for. Also, to realize that, when she thought she could have caught COVID, there was no option for her to get tested without risking friends since she had to rely on them to go get tested. This is another example of how our healthcare system is very unprepared to help disable people due to privatization, lack of legislation protecting disable, systematic white supremacy that hinders other groups like she pointed out. Lastly, Emily tried to point out the root cause of the systematic Ableism she faced which were the state of Pennsylvania, government in general, or her university. This could indicate how some of those problems could be local and not necessarily nationwide. For example, I personally only know of people in California and New York that knew when they were receiving their vaccination days if not weeks ahead of time. 
Emily’s choice of naming her article “My Year of Nothing but Everything” shows how polarized her year was. Our government, her university, and healthcare system failed her however she found comfort and strength in other marginalized groups. She helped me understand how being in her situation amplifies hardships in unimaginable ways but also how mutual support and community is key for physical and metal survival. Her well written personal letter was split into groups of related parts in a chronological way making it all clear and easy to understand.",Yes,Mobility

It also brought the loses of not having a comprehensive health care system to another perspective. Emily showed me how disabled people have to rely on being resilient constantly and dependent of peoples help since our health care system and government do not offer enough help for them to be more independent of personal connections. Also, having a sneak peak on her daily routine and how difficult it is for her and how many hours it take to get the her basic need met definitely show how equity is important to guarantee that those differences are accounted for.",Auto-ethnographic Reflection,Mobility
