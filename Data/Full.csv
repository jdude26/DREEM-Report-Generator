Her comment “as a person who has trouble surviving the common cold” shows how she disproportionally is affected by a regular cold and how the pandemic situation took a toll on her mental health and willingness or fear to go places. 
In the second paragraph, exposed a difficult reality for those who depend of others for their most basic personal needs. She previously had 10-15 personal care aides to help her with 6 hours of daily basic needs but their inability to isolate themselves presented a risk to Emily. This generated an internal conflict between getting infected and having her basic needs met. Like she said “for the first time ever in adulthood, I’ve found myself resentful and wishing for the ability to truly live independently without the need for assistance with my daily activities”.

This generated months of anxiety and when they finally moved people under 64 with high-risk to highest priority, Emily battle became to prove she was one of them to whoever was responsible for the vaccination. Lack of guidelines, information, proper procedure, and systematic ableism lead to Emily trying to prove she was in that group even though being of young age.
Fourth paragraph goes in detail how the state’s recognition of her need for early vaccination did not translate to accessible vaccination. Places responsible for distriburing vaccines had people entering their information to register for vaccination on demand and Emily’s compromised motor abilities made it extra difficult for her to fill out those forms quickly in order to guarantee a spot. Also, this same system would generate one day’s notice appointment which for someone who relies on others to almost everything is like she says “the disable nightmare”.",

Emily expose the difficulty to get an appointment through CVS since it was open to millions of people, the inability to get vaccinated through her school even though that was a much smaller set of eligible students, and the fact that private medical practitioners were overwhelmed by the general public and did not present a viable way for her to get her vaccine or even general information.

Emily points out that Facebook became a double swarded resource since it helped her see the broader difficulties faced by different communities of her region and see that she was not alone but at the same time the Facebook group exposed “emotional extremes”. She points out that it was challenge to handle those emotional appeals online and it also revealed how disable lives overall were disproportionally left out since the beginning of quarantine. Emily includes BIPOC into her analyses of those left out and criticizes white supremacy as part of the US medical bias. Other spect Emily writes about is the “history of defunded public health in favor of privatization” which lead to poor infrastructure and unequal system is the exchange of the ultimate goal of profit which affected minorities disproportionally.

Emily shares that she got her first dose on February 17th on a day’s notice opportunity that was 1.5 hours away from her. This is a clear demonstration of how inaccessible the process was. Emily had the help of a queer BIPOC to help her achieve her vaccination goal and how that same person was tested positive a few days later which put her in stress and made Emily feel bad for having asked that person to expose themselves and because of that they could have potentially exposed other. As Emely reports “anyone who lives independently dependently knows the internalized ableism that materializes as guilt for asking for too much from others” which gives us a peek of how ableism can manifest within a disable person which I imagine to be mentally challenging to deal with because on matter how she feels she still cannot change her condition. Another peek to a disable person journey during COVID, “asking the people I love to knowingly expose themselves while waiting for my test results was something I hope to never need to do again” this shows that a disable person who have been exposed still have to rely on someone willingness to take them to a testing site which also means willingness to expose themselves. Emily ends her letter by wishing that after the health and institutional disparities that the COVID situation helped expose will gain more national visibility even after the pandemic and hopefully trigger systematic changes.

The vaccination roll out has been advertised as an equitable and on paper it is however Emily shows us that systemic ableism does not disappear even when top officials try to implement a fair approach. Her need is easy to understand and quite obvious to see but still she struggled to get her first vaccine. It is worth mentioning that Emily is finishing her PhD program and is probably very resourceful, very comfortable with science, and capable to understand and handle the situation still she struggled to get something she was entitled to. The vaccination eligibility was made equitable but the accessibility to it was not. It is also important to notice that days’ notice vaccination is not something disable people can easily accommodate for. Also, to realize that, when she thought she could have caught COVID, there was no option for her to get tested without risking friends since she had to rely on them to go get tested. This is another example of how our healthcare system is very unprepared to help disable people due to privatization, lack of legislation protecting disable, systematic white supremacy that hinders other groups like she pointed out. Lastly, Emily tried to point out the root cause of the systematic ableism she faced which were the state of Pennsylvania, government in general, or her university. This could indicate how some of those problems could be local and not necessarily nationwide. For example, I personally only know of people in California and New York that knew when they were receiving their vaccination days if not weeks ahead of time. 
Emily’s choice of naming her article “My Year of Nothing but Everything” shows how polarized her year was. Our government, her university, and healthcare system failed her however she found comfort and strength in other marginalized groups. She helped me understand how being in her situation amplifies hardships in unimaginable ways but also how mutual support and community is key for physical and metal survival.

The vaccination roll out has been advertised as an equitable and on paper it is however Emily shows us that systemic ableism does not disappear even when top officials try to implement a fair approach. Her need is easy to understand and quite obvious to see but still she struggled to get her first vaccine. It is worth mentioning that Emily is finishing her PhD program and is probably very resourceful, very comfortable with science, and capable to understand and handle the situation still she struggled to get something she was entitled to. The vaccination eligibility was made equitable but the accessibility to it was not. It is also important to notice that days’ notice vaccination is not something disable people can easily accommodate for. Also, to realize that, when she thought she could have caught COVID, there was no option for her to get tested without risking friends since she had to rely on them to go get tested. This is another example of how our healthcare system is very unprepared to help disable people due to privatization, lack of legislation protecting disable, systematic white supremacy that hinders other groups like she pointed out. Lastly, Emily tried to point out the root cause of the systematic ableism she faced which were the state of Pennsylvania, government in general, or her university. This could indicate how some of those problems could be local and not necessarily nationwide. For example, I personally only know of people in California and New York that knew when they were receiving their vaccination days if not weeks ahead of time. 
Emily’s choice of naming her article “My Year of Nothing but Everything” shows how polarized her year was. Our government, her university, and healthcare system failed her however she found comfort and strength in other marginalized groups. She helped me understand how being in her situation amplifies hardships in unimaginable ways but also how mutual support and community is key for physical and metal survival.

She gives a very detailed description, including specific dates and ages. I think that this makes the experience seem more personal to the person reading this, as it solidifies the experience through actual numbers. This level of detail of her hardships touches my heart, especially since that this is the first time I've been able to read about the darker side of Tourette's instead of the comedic sides that I've seen go viral. The possible injuries and dangerous situations that she had gone through at such a young age made me realize the reality of this disability. In that sense, I think she did a great job educating the viewers through her personal journey. Additionally, she included more links within this page about her tics, struggles, methods/things that helped her, and general information about what Tourette's are. Her descriptions and explanations are easy to understand as a person who doesn't know much about Tourette's. I think that this very personal account of her life allowed me to empathize with her, even if I will never be able to fully understand. At the very least, I am now knowledgeable of what she and others experience. And it is through her personal experience I can more easily understand the disability itself. I also like how the blog name is ""TicTastic!"" because it creates a positive energy. Although with the trending videos of tics recently, I wonder if this might only support the recent comedic aspects of Tourette's. While the rising awareness could be a good thing, I think that new stereotypes might arise and undermine the struggles of Tourette's. But I think her intention was to create a bright and child-like logo to highlight that the blog is about her experience of growing up and pushing through with Tourette's and OCD. ",

And additionally, with remote learning, more interactions between professors and students are more private, which means that other students and staff are less likely to recognize ableism in a classroom setting.

I wasn’t sure how to address some parts of the disability, like how to talk about the tics and what kind of terminology I should be using to talk about it. The logging process is getting more comfortable now; I just need to get more comfortable with putting my thoughts in words. And compared to my last close reading, I chose a longer Youtube video this time. And I found myself using the end time more to do a close reading. Looking at my peers’ responses, I realized that they had more of an immediate reaction. I don’t think that my responses show my emotions or what I’m feeling at that moment in the video. I haven’t really found things that could inspire technology design, but I did learn about Tourettes in a natural setting and that made me start thinking about how technology design could be inspired.

This was repeated multiple times, and it shows that the creator was most bothered by this. One thing I did learn is that the creator does not wholeheartedly agree with the term “ableism”. It was naïve of me to think that the disabled community would gladly accept this term, especially when some people in this community did not even know the term existed. I think this really does support the idea of lack of education and publicity when it comes to ableism. As for the logging process, I do feel a bit awkward with the commentary. I’m still trying to get comfortable finding the balance between my own emotional commentary and analysis. I still question myself if what I have written is good enough.",Auto-ethnographic Reflection

One thing that I noticed was that she seemed to have difficulty moving her arm. Because I don’t want to assume anything, I tried to go see her blog if there was a more detailed description about her disability, and I had no luck yet. But just based on observations, she seemed to have trouble moving her arm, specifically her left. And while I do see a lot of wheelchairs and technologies for actual movement, I don’t recall technology design for arm mobility. Personally, for the logging process, I’m still trying to get comfortable with it. There isn’t anything wrong with the process itself, if anything, it’s efficient.

In the case of Anita, she had a lot of verbal tics, in which she said false and random things without being able to control it. I saw that the other players were respectful, not making fun of her tics and not really putting her down for it either. She was also able to teach them and the viewers about tics and how they work, which I thought could be a good way to spread more awareness and educate the public in content that people would be interested in. I think that for the logging process, I found myself getting more comfortable with the topic portion. But today, I did two close readings, and usually I send myself the responses to keep track. But since I did two, they seemed to be overlapped in one email now. It would be great to find a way to work around that, but for now, the only solution I can think of is to do one a day.",Auto-ethnographic Reflection

The creator had a chance to explain to the players that echo is when a person with Tourette’s repeats what they have heard earlier, and the repetition has an effect on the tic as well. Additionally, the tics may morph into new tic. This was new information to me, and it was a topic that I was curious about as I did my close readings. Now that I have this new information, I was able to recognize more patterns in her tics and other the tics of other creators as well, like the change in tone or accents and the words that she uses. This creator’s videos also debunked my initial assumption that the tics would affect her gameplay. Her tics didn’t cause her to make mistakes or create undesired gameplay.

Other media that I have watched for close reading, they seemed to highlight the comedic aspects and create humorous light in (potentially dangerous) moments caused by tics. But through the detailed and informative tone of the blog, I was able to realize the extent to which the media, specifically the recent comedic ones, can influence the way that we see disabilities. I’ve previously thought that awareness was good, but I haven’t really considered how it might cover up parts of the reality of the disabilities. I think that it is through these selective publicity that incorrect assumptions and stereotypes are born. I think this kind of awareness is very informative and important, as it reminded me of the reality of this disability instead of what the media has consistently shown me. While I know that the other creators did not have bad intentions with their content, I just worry about how people will see Tourette’s in the long run.

They were all mindful of the creator and her baking, but they all let her do her own thing, giving her her own independence in the process. I think that this was great to see, in that some people might try to overly help them because of the thought that the people with this disability are not able to do things themselves. I also saw that they were all very patient and positive even in times of the accidents. I thought that this was a sign of education about Tourette's (I would assume they understood because they are family members). This was one of the valuable thoughts/ideas I found through this video, of how education could help to reduce ableism in society. For the logging process, I had some trouble concentrating today, and felt tired by the end of it despite the fact that the video was shorter than the ones I have done before. This makes me wonder if my state would end up affecting my empathy and the way that I write. And if so, would there be an optimal time or state to do closing readings.",Auto-ethnographic Reflection

I think the main take away for me is to make your morning routines a fun event, not a laundry list of to do items. I was interested in this video to see what kinds of products she used, but it actually was more valuable to me to see how she went about her routine. I was interested in her perspectives on technology. She seemed to dislike social media use even though she is a content creator. She doesn’t use tech in the morning but she does use it for led meditation and led yoga. I wonder if it would be possible to have a led morning routine. That would actually be kind of helpful for me, but maybe a little bit silly. 
As a whole a trend I’ve seen emerging is celebration in care. Both self care and for others. This comes from the close readings I’ve done in this project, but also from my personal reading list (Thinking of Care Work in particular). ",Auto-ethnographic Reflection

I chose this reading because, like the author, I have spent much of my young adult life in and out of hospitals caring for my parents. Most recently the last several weeks with my dad, so it seemed relevant. I’ve often felt angry that my parents are always in this situation when it seems like my peers' parents are all in good health. I feel totally silly, but I’ve chalked it up to socioeconomic status and the fact that my dad is an immigrant with brown skin, a heavy accent, and a rare chronic illness. Hospital care is different for him than those I’ve cared for who are white or higher economic status. Anyway. I’ve brought this up in therapy and stuff but always just feel like I’m drawing correlations that don’t actually exist outside of my head. This is the first time I’ve read something that confirms my feelings and experiences. It was pretty powerful and emotional for me, so I think I need to give myself a break on the close reading for a few days. I do think I got a lot out of it on a personal level, so I’m glad I read it. I think it’s possible that it was so powerful to me because it was written sort of as a personal account / blog post kinda thing. I don’t think I would have had the same reaction to data, although it would still make me sad.

One really clear pattern to me was how bad people were at actually giving help when asked for it. It’s like, how hard is it to just listen to what someone says they need? Instead people make a lot of assumptions about Mona’s needs or point in a direction when she asks “left or right?” 
The logging process for time didn’t work for me after 12 minutes of the video. 
So far I’ve really enjoyed watching videos in this critical way because it allows me to digest other things I’ve learned in disability studies. Today I saw concrete examples of ableism, forced intimacy and access intimacy which were things I have been reading about this week. 
I’m excited to see how others use their retrospective writings but I think I’m the first so far! The only thing that’s stuck out to me so far about technology design is how annoying siri can be for doing repetitive tasks. I wish she had some memory and didn’t say the same thing over and over. I also thought it was interesting that even though the screenreader was set to read really fast, siri was pretty slow. Is there a way to adjust siri’s speed?

From this video, I noticed that she depends a lot on tactile design and embossing of the makeup’s packaging in order to identify them (e.g. water drops to signify waterproof mascara and raised letters on the eyeshadow palette). While this may seem like just a design choice to most abled people, small details like this help blind people establish a daily routine where they can put on makeup independently and easefully. Burke mainly relies on her senses of touch and smell to identify products and use them. I was intrigued when she said she likes the brand Too Faced’s scented products. I thought their products were kind of gimmicky but they work for her needs. She also uses her knowledge of color theory in order to plan a wearable eyeshadow look despite her lack of color and brightness perception. Watching this video taught me to focus more on the small but impactful details on makeup products that affect one’s ability to utilize it effectively. I highly respect how Burke calls out makeup manufacturers on how inaccessible some products are and advocates for more inclusive product designs.",Auto-ethnographic Reflection

I think that folks use words like anxiety and depression a lot without actually meaning it as a full blown psychological thing. I’m not sure how much that matters in this case, because we are still talking about the experience of anxiety or depression? But I think that’s one thing to look out for. People might use terms related to mental health very lightly, or even in totally ableist ways (I’m looking at you, r/wallstreetbets). If someone is claiming to be autistic and actually isn’t that would suck to get trapped by in this case.

I have been getting deeper into these communities over the last few years so it makes sense. I think twitter has helped me a lot because I’m already following a lot of folks in the disability community who share their and other’s work. Hashtags have been super helpful too on twitter because people discuss topics or identify themselves as #mad or #spoonie or #neisvoid etc. One thing that I considered while looking for content today is how much I love some content made by my friends or colleagues in various disability communities, but I felt too weird about analyzing their content and publishing it in a paper. I also keep thinking about what the people reading our work are going to think. Like, oh of course Bre would choose these people. Maybe I’m leaving people out? Maybe I’m too much in my own bubble?  I’m not sure why I feel that, but thought it was worth writing about here.

Some of the inventors have disabilities themselves, such as motor impairments in the upper limbs, that impeded them from using their own makeup products. They designed beauty tools, like brushes with modified grips, that are more comfortable to use and allow them to get the job done faster. I was inspired by the creativity and dedication of these innovators, but I was also feeling disheartened. It felt unfair to see ordinary people use all their money and time to create these products without any funding or support from the big cosmetic corporations. They still don’t care enough about their disabled consumers to make truly accessible products that everyone can use.

All homeless people should put down the bottle and get to work. Never mind that most of them have mental health symptoms and physical ailments, and are fighting constantly to be recognized as human. Never mind that they are unable to get a good night’s rest or a nourishing meal for weeks or months on end. Never mind that even in my comfortable, easy life, I can’t go a few days without craving a drink or making an irresponsible purchase. They have to do better.""


Not sure how to feel about equating homelessness to a disability, but I do think it illustrates well how people can rationalize out their empathy simply it because it validates their positionality. The author, Devon, actually says this outright- ""Few people who haven’t been homeless think this way. They want to moralize the decisions of poor people, perhaps to comfort themselves about the injustices of the world. For many, it’s easier to think homeless people are, in part, responsible for their suffering than it is to acknowledge the situational factors.""

The same idea could be applied to disabilities-- if the privileged have to consider what it might be like living with a disability, then it would force them to acknowledge that society fails many of those with disabilities.",
