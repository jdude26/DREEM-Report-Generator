The vaccination roll out has been advertised as an equitable and on paper it is however Emily shows us that systemic Ableism does not disappear even when top officials try to implement a fair approach. Her need is easy to understand and quite obvious to see but still she struggled to get her first vaccine. It is worth mentioning that Emily is finishing her PhD program and is probably very resourceful, very comfortable with science, and capable to understand and handle the situation still she struggled to get something she was entitled to. The vaccination eligibility was made equitable but the accessibility to it was not. It is also important to notice that days’ notice vaccination is not something disable people can easily accommodate for. Also, to realize that, when she thought she could have caught COVID, there was no option for her to get tested without risking friends since she had to rely on them to go get tested. This is another example of how our healthcare system is very unprepared to help disable people due to privatization, lack of legislation protecting disable, systematic white supremacy that hinders other groups like she pointed out. Lastly, Emily tried to point out the root cause of the systematic Ableism she faced which were the state of Pennsylvania, government in general, or her university. This could indicate how some of those problems could be local and not necessarily nationwide. For example, I personally only know of people in California and New York that knew when they were receiving their vaccination days if not weeks ahead of time. 
Emily’s choice of naming her article “My Year of Nothing but Everything” shows how polarized her year was. Our government, her university, and healthcare system failed her however she found comfort and strength in other marginalized groups. She helped me understand how being in her situation amplifies hardships in unimaginable ways but also how mutual support and community is key for physical and metal survival. Her well written personal letter was split into groups of related parts in a chronological way making it all clear and easy to understand.",Yes,Aesthetic

Some of the inventors have disabilities themselves, such as motor impairments in the upper limbs, that impeded them from using their own makeup products. They designed beauty tools, like brushes with modified grips, that are more comfortable to use and allow them to get the job done faster. I was inspired by the creativity and dedication of these innovators, but I was also feeling disheartened. It felt unfair to see ordinary people use all their money and time to create these products without any funding or support from the big cosmetic corporations. They still don’t care enough about their disabled consumers to make truly accessible products that everyone can use.",Auto-ethnographic Reflection,Aesthetic

There's no music, just the audio of the room with birds outside the window. This quiet start is a stark contrast to anxiety. With a million thoughts flying around in your head it can be difficult to be in quiet spaces like this. I think this is a really nice start. You can tell that the bed was made before she got in it. She then gets up and makes it before starting her day. Her laptop is in the bed so it feels lived in, not totally perfect.

Implies that checking off tasks from a list can be unhelpful for anxiety. 

Keep care simple. It's hard to keep caring for yourself if it feels like just another task. That's a nice takeaway. I would also add from what I've learning in this video: Keep care simple and celebratory.",,Aesthetic

I think the main take away for me is to make your morning routines a fun event, not a laundry list of to do items. I was interested in this video to see what kinds of products she used, but it actually was more valuable to me to see how she went about her routine. I was interested in her perspectives on technology. She seemed to dislike social media use even though she is a content creator. She doesn’t use tech in the morning but she does use it for led meditation and led yoga. I wonder if it would be possible to have a led morning routine. That would actually be kind of helpful for me, but maybe a little bit silly. As a whole a trend I’ve seen emerging is celebration in care. Both self care and for others.

From this video, I noticed that she depends a lot on tactile design and embossing of the makeup’s packaging in order to identify them (e.g. water drops to signify waterproof mascara and raised letters on the eyeshadow palette). While this may seem like just a design choice to most abled people, small details like this help blind people establish a daily routine where they can put on makeup independently and easefully. Burke mainly relies on her senses of touch and smell to identify products and use them. I was intrigued when she said she likes the brand Too Faced’s scented products. I thought their products were kind of gimmicky but they work for her needs. She also uses her knowledge of color theory in order to plan a wearable eyeshadow look despite her lack of color and brightness perception. Watching this video taught me to focus more on the small but impactful details on makeup products that affect one’s ability to utilize it effectively. I highly respect how Burke calls out makeup manufacturers on how inaccessible some products are and advocates for more inclusive product designs.",Auto-ethnographic Reflection,Aesthetic
