She implies that people who ""champion inclusivity"" often fail to understand this disadvantage because they believe that they too, to some extent, undergo the same challenges autistics do.",,Autism

A lot of society expects that any accommodation beyond initial help isn't an accommodation, but rather a nuisance.",,Autism

It's really easy to feel incompetent when you don't necessarily know what's expected of you Maybe this could also really apply to ppl with PTSD or ACES?????
She's also mentioning how society seems to value generalists way over specialists and how autistic people tend to be specialists-- literally just another barrier autistics need to overcome",,Autism

Anonymous 4,https://youtu.be/ZX4b1yZxkd0,Ignorant People & Autism,,0:10:10,0:11:10,"ignorance, learning, autism, empathy",I want to know where that unwillingness comes from. Sometimes I find it in myself and it's over stupid shit that I don't even think is worth dying for. I think people just naturally don't want to be wrong and it takes a lot of effort to become a person who's willing to change. will prolly write more on this,,Autism
