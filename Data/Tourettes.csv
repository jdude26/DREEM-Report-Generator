4/8/2021 21:31:26,Anonymous 4,https://www.tictastic.com/my-story/,blog about personal experience by person with Tourette's,,,,"blog, tourettes, tics, treatment, experience","Wilamena writes about her journey in life with tics, starting from the first sign of Tourette's to her treatment experiences. She gives a very detailed description, including specific dates and ages. I think that this makes the experience seem more personal to the person reading this, as it solidifies the experience through actual numbers. This level of detail of her hardships touches my heart, especially since that this is the first time I've been able to read about the darker side of Tourette's instead of the comedic sides that I've seen go viral. The possible injuries and dangerous situations that she had gone through at such a young age made me realize the reality of this disability. In that sense, I think she did a great job educating the viewers through her personal journey. Additionally, she included more links within this page about her tics, struggles, methods/things that helped her, and general information about what Tourette's are. Her descriptions and explanations are easy to understand as a person who doesn't know much about Tourette's. I think that this very personal account of her life allowed me to empathize with her, even if I will never be able to fully understand. At the very least, I am now knowledgeable of what she and others experience. And it is through her personal experience I can more easily understand the disability itself. I also like how the blog name is ""TicTastic!"" because it creates a positive energy. Although with the trending videos of tics recently, I wonder if this might only support the recent comedic aspects of Tourette's. While the rising awareness could be a good thing, I think that new stereotypes might arise and undermine the struggles of Tourette's. But I think her intention was to create a bright and child-like logo to highlight that the blog is about her experience of growing up and pushing through with Tourette's and OCD.",,Tourettes

Other media that I have watched for close reading, they seemed to highlight the comedic aspects and create humorous light in (potentially dangerous) moments caused by tics. But through the detailed and informative tone of the blog, I was able to realize the extent to which the media, specifically the recent comedic ones, can influence the way that we see disabilities. I’ve previously thought that awareness was good, but I haven’t really considered how it might cover up parts of the reality of the disabilities. I think that it is through these selective publicity that incorrect assumptions and stereotypes are born. I think this kind of awareness is very informative and important, as it reminded me of the reality of this disability instead of what the media has consistently shown me. While I know that the other creators did not have bad intentions with their content, I just worry about how people will see Tourette’s in the long run.",Auto-ethnographic Reflection,Tourettes

I think that this was a good question to ask before the games. Aside from the fact that the intention of this question was because her tics can accidentally sabotage her, it also provides a moment of awareness of Tourette's as a disability and also an opportunity to educate others. But in this situation, other people knew what Tourette's were and the opportunity passed. But there was an awkward pause after the question was asked, and the players seemed hesitant to answer to the point where one of the players said ""anyone want to speak up?"". I wonder why they were hesitant to answer. Were they just rethinking about what Tourette's were?",,Tourettes

I think this is a good example of some of the issues that people with Tourette's go through. She didn't exactly explain how the conversation exactly went, but I would like to say that probably explaining that she has Tourette's might have helped with the issue of them hanging up. But that is only the case if the person on the line knew what Tourette's are. Otherwise, she would have to explain and educate them, which would take a bit of time. So I think that if the employee knew what Tourette's are and if the creator mentioned that she has Tourette's, it would have been a manageable situation.

This was repeated multiple times, and it shows that the creator was most bothered by this. One thing I did learn is that the creator does not wholeheartedly agree with the term “Ableism”. It was naïve of me to think that the disabled community would gladly accept this term, especially when some people in this community did not even know the term existed. I think this really does support the idea of lack of education and publicity when it comes to Ableism. As for the logging process, I do feel a bit awkward with the commentary.

This style of editing is often used in other vlogs as well. I think this matches well with the age of the creator (she seems pretty young) and goes to show the intended atmosphere of the video.

In other videos, it seems to highlight or mostly use clips that highlight the tics and the funny scenes, but she chooses clips doesn't necessarily hold her tics as her main source of content. Expected because she is a gamer, also not because I thought maybe she'd use more clips of her tics.",,Tourettes

The creator then explains that her tics are often not about what she is thinking and that they're not always the truth, and that she cannot control what she says. Other players seem to be respectfully listening. I think that this would've been an educating moment for both the players and the viewers, especially as they have both witnessed and learned about Tourette's from the person with this disability.",,Tourettes

Although she is saying unrelated things due to her tics, the other players remain patient. The questioner does ask ""where are you actually?"", and his tone was a little flat (?) but all the players remained silent to let her talk and managed to find the answer during her tics. Questioner's tone brightened up a bit after getting the answer. It's nice to see that the people were just listening and not trying to make fun of her.",,Tourettes

He gets her intended words correctly, but I wonder how she feels in that situation. Would she rather have others wait for her to speak her own thoughts or have someone else try to interpret her words?",,Tourettes

In the case of Anita, she had a lot of verbal tics, in which she said false and random things without being able to control it. I saw that the other players were respectful, not making fun of her tics and not really putting her down for it either. She was also able to teach them and the viewers about tics and how they work, which I thought could be a good way to spread more awareness and educate the public in content that people would be interested in. I think that for the logging process, I found myself getting more comfortable with the topic portion. But today, I did two close readings, and usually I send myself the responses to keep track. But since I did two, they seemed to be overlapped in one email now. It would be great to find a way to work around that, but for now, the only solution I can think of is to do one a day.",Auto-ethnographic Reflection,Tourettes
