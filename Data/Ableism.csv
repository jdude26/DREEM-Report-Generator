It happened twice that when Shane as a disabled person, there was little to non guidance or clarification to what exactly was happening and what the next steps would look like. I understand it as a form of Ableism where he was just being taken places or redirected and not actually being talked to or having the situation explained. It is great that those tourist attraction places had a way for him to access them with his wheelchair but not communicating with him and asking what he was okay and with shows abled people making decisions for disables.",Auto-ethnographic Reflection,Ableism

Much of Fanon’s work examined hospitals as institutions of social control, medicalising criminality, and exercising colonial powers."" Starting the document out with a famous black philosopher / physician / psychologist and influence on critical theory is a strong start - makes me think this is going to be kind of an intense read. I didn't know who Frantz Fanon was initially so had to look up his history. He argues that the ""creation of specific mental “pathologies” and “disorders”"" are a result of colonialism. I suspect ""control"" is going to be a big part of this read. Colonialism = control of countries. Mental health labeling and hospitalization result in social control.

Anonymous 3,https://overland.org.au/previous-issues/issue-239/feature-on-hospitals/,Failed to complete reading,,,,"emotional, hospitals","This was a really emotional read for me, I actually stopped in the middle of the close reading when it started getting real and I’m not totally sure I want to continue. I chose this reading because, like the author, I have spent much of my young adult life in and out of hospitals caring for my parents. Most recently the last several weeks with my dad, so it seemed relevant. I’ve often felt angry that my parents are always in this situation when it seems like my peers' parents are all in good health. I feel totally silly, but I’ve chalked it up to socioeconomic status and the fact that my dad is an immigrant with brown skin, a heavy accent, and a rare chronic illness. Hospital care is different for him than those I’ve cared for who are white or higher economic status. Anyway. I’ve brought this up in therapy and stuff but always just feel like I’m drawing correlations that don’t actually exist outside of my head. This is the first time I’ve read something that confirms my feelings and experiences. It was pretty powerful and emotional for me, so I think I need to give myself a break on the close reading for a few days. I do think I got a lot out of it on a personal level, so I’m glad I read it. I think it’s possible that it was so powerful to me because it was written sort of as a personal account / blog post kinda thing. I don’t think I would have had the same reaction to data, although it would still make me sad.",,Ableism-Instituitionalism
